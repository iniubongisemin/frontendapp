/* These CSS styles define the appearance for a list (ul) within an element with the class 'cat' and links (a) within the same class. The list is set to display as a column with a gap between rows, while the links have styling for border-radius, border, and padding. Note that the rgb(52, green, blue) placeholder should be replaced with specific values or variables for the actual color. */
